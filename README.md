# My Quizz Challenge!
## Project 2 (Javascript)

### Hello and welcome to my Readme.md. I'm going to explain about my Quizz Challenge and how it works.

## Overview 
### This project is a Quizz Challenge and users are going to answer on four questions with different options, sometimes there are two options sometimes three or four.
In the end you can get a max score of four points, the quizz will tell you how many correct answers you've got in the ending.
It's easy for the user to keep track both to the ***scoreboard*** and the ***countdown timer*** which is 10 seconds for each question!


## Website Features

### Countdown for every question.
### Different color depending on the user's answer.
### Scoreboard in the end of the quizz.
### Restart button at the end if the user want to replay!
