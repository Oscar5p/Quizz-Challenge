## Overview 
### This project is a Quizz Challenge and users are going to answer on four questions with different options, sometimes there are two options sometimes three or four.
In the end you can get a max score of four points, the quizz will tell you how many correct answers you've got in the ending.
It's easy for the user to keep track both to the ***scoreboard*** and the ***countdown timer*** which is 10 seconds for each question!


## Website Features

### Countdown for every question.
### Different color depending on the user's answer.
### Scoreboard in the end of the quizz.
### Restart button at the end if the user want to replay!


## How To Use My Website!
### How To Play
Simply click on the "Start" button to start my quizz.
The timer will begin when you press "Start" and you've got 10 seconds on every question, and if you don't answer you will get wrong and get moved to the next one.
At the end you will get your score and you can also hit the "Restart" button if you'd like to play again!
